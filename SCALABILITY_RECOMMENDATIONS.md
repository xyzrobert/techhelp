# Scalability Recommendations for Klarfix

## Current Limitations

- In-memory storage (server/storage.ts) is not suitable for production as it doesn't persist across server restarts and can't scale horizontally.
- JWT tokens are using a static secret key which won't work well in a distributed environment.

## Recommended Changes

### 1. Database Storage
Replace the in-memory storage with a proper database:
- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB for relational data (users, bookings, services)
- Consider using Redis for caching and session management
- Store database connection strings in environment variables

### 2. Stateless Authentication
- Store JWT secret in environment variables
- Consider using a dedicated auth service or identity provider for larger scale

### 3. Deployment Architecture
- Implement proper API routes with versioning
- Use a load balancer for distributing traffic
- Consider containerization for consistent environments
- Implement health checks and monitoring

### 4. Caching Strategy
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use client-side caching where appropriate
- Consider a CDN for static assets

### 5. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement centralized logging
- Add proper error boundaries in React components
- Create a monitoring dashboard

These recommendations will help make the application more scalable and robust for production use.
