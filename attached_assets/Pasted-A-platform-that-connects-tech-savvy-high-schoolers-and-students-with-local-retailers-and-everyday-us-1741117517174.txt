A platform that connects tech-savvy high schoolers and students with local retailers and everyday users (like your average grandma) who need IT support. Businesses and individuals can request help for hardware setups, software troubleshooting, and system configurations, while students who sign up as support providers are listed in an "Online Now" tab, making it easy to find available help in real time. This creates an affordable, on-demand tech support network where students gain hands-on experience and earn money.

The server is running on port 5000
You can see the homepage with active helpers
There's a settings dropdown in the navigation for managing helpers
The website supports user profiles, service booking, and helper management

Oh, you want to get the files for running this website yourself? I'll help you understand the file structure and what you need:

You need these main folders:
/client - Contains the React frontend code
/server - Contains the Node.js backend code
/shared - Contains shared types and schemas
Each file serves a specific purpose:
package.json - Lists all dependencies
theme.json - Controls the website's appearance
tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
vite.config.ts - Vite build configuration
Would you like me to explain more about how to get these files set up on your machine?

Since you want to have the files for yourself, let me help you download and run this project locally:

First, you'll need to create a new repository and add these files:
For the server-side:

server/index.ts
server/routes.ts
server/storage.ts
server/vite.ts
For the client-side:

All files under client/src/ including components, pages
client/index.html
Configuration files:

package.json (for dependencies)
tsconfig.json
vite.config.ts
theme.json
postcss.config.js
tailwind.config.ts
Would you like me to show you the contents of each file or help you set them up in a particular order?

can you add some buttons with no functionality yet? like help me make this mvp. i still think the main homepage is way too complicated for elderly flashy and idfk. the main page should be actually more blank, translate it to german and name it "smartfreund". Die "hilfe" button sollte gros sein, und dannach sollte man auf die "active helpers page kommen", eine live chat feature sollte auch da sein, gemeinsam mit ne kontakt mit telefon nr von offene helpern (die konnen das selber einstellen)

I understand you want to simplify the homepage and make it more accessible for elderly users in German under the name "SmartFreund". You want:

A simpler homepage with a large "Hilfe" button
Direct access to active helpers after clicking help
Live chat feature
Phone contact option for online helpers (configurable by helpers)

No login required
User clicks on a helper
User enters their phone number
Helper gets notified and confirms
After confirmation, helper receives the elderly person's phone number
Let me modify the system to implement this simpler flow.
